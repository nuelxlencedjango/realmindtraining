                        <p>There is no doubt that data has been refered as the new oil and those who have the required skills make it 3 times than an average worker.Machines only thrive based on the data available to them. </p>
                          <p> Machine Learning is the pathway to the most exciting careers in data analysis. As data sources proliferate along with the ability to process them, going straight to the data is one of the most straightforward ways to quickly gain insights and make predictions</p>

                        <p>Machine learning is the act  of getting computers to work without being explicitly informed. In recent times, machine learning has provided us with  self-driving cars,speech recognition,  web search, and  improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning has so become the other of the day that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. A lot of people think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI.</p>
                        <p> In this course, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practically implementing them and getting them to work for yourself.</p>

                        <p> This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition.</p>

                        <p>By the end of the course , You will  gain the practical know-how needed to apply these techniques to new problems.</p>
